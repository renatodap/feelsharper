## üìà Deployment Commands

```bash
# Final deployment sequence
cd feelsharper-deploy

# 1. Run final checks
npm run typecheck    # Non-critical errors only
npm test            # All tests pass
npm run build       # Successful build

# 2. Deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod

# 3. Set environment variables in Vercel
# (Use rotated API keys)

# 4. Verify deployment
curl https://your-app.vercel.app
```
