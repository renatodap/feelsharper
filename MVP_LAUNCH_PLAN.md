**Priority: P0 - Security vulnerability in automatic schema evolution**

- [ ] 1.5.1 **REDESIGN Database Evolution Security Architecture**
  - [ ] Replace automatic DDL operations with secure JSONB approach
  - [ ] Remove SQL injection vulnerabilities in migration generation
  - [ ] Implement principle of least privilege for database access
  - [ ] Create secure pattern analysis without raw user data access
  
- [ ] 1.5.2 **Implement PostgreSQL + JSONB Hybrid Architecture**
  ```sql
  -- Secure dynamic fields without schema changes
  ALTER TABLE activity_logs ADD COLUMN ai_discovered_fields JSONB DEFAULT '{}';
  ALTER TABLE activity_logs ADD COLUMN user_custom_fields JSONB DEFAULT '{}';
  ALTER TABLE activity_logs ADD COLUMN field_confidence JSONB DEFAULT '{}';
  ALTER TABLE activity_logs ADD COLUMN schema_version INTEGER DEFAULT 1;
  ```
  
- [ ] 1.5.3 **Create Secure Schema Evolution System**
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE schema_evolution_requests (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    pattern_analysis JSONB NOT NULL,
    proposed_changes JSONB NOT NULL,
    confidence_score DECIMAL(3,2) NOT NULL,
    affected_users INTEGER NOT NULL,
    status TEXT CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'approved', 'rejected', 'applied')),
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    approved_by UUID REFERENCES admin_users(id),
    applied_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
    rollback_script TEXT
  );
  ```
  
- [ ] 1.5.4 **Implement Row-Level Security (RLS)**
  ```sql
  -- Enable RLS on all sensitive tables
  ALTER TABLE activity_logs ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
  ALTER TABLE user_profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
  ALTER TABLE schema_evolution_requests ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
  
  -- Users can only access their own data
  CREATE POLICY "Users see own activities" ON activity_logs
    FOR ALL USING (user_id = auth.uid());
    
  -- Only admins can approve schema changes
  CREATE POLICY "Only admins can approve schema changes" 
    ON schema_evolution_requests
    FOR UPDATE USING (auth.jwt() ->> 'role' = 'admin');
  ```
  
- [ ] 1.5.5 **Create Separate Database Roles**
  ```sql
  -- Analytics role with minimal permissions
  CREATE ROLE schema_analyzer WITH LOGIN;
  GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO schema_analyzer;
  GRANT SELECT ON activity_logs TO schema_analyzer;
  -- No DDL permissions, no individual user data access
  
  -- App role with RLS enforced
  CREATE ROLE app_user WITH LOGIN;
  GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON activity_logs TO app_user;
  -- No ALTER TABLE, no DROP permissions
  ```
  
- [ ] 1.5.6 **Rewrite SecureSchemaAnalyzer Class**
  ```typescript
  class SecureSchemaAnalyzer {
    async analyzePatterns() {
      // Use aggregate queries - no individual data access
      const patterns = await this.db.query(`
        SELECT 
          jsonb_object_keys(ai_discovered_fields) as field_name,
          COUNT(*) as frequency,
          COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as user_count  -- No actual user_ids
        FROM activity_logs 
        WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
        GROUP BY jsonb_object_keys(ai_discovered_fields)
        HAVING COUNT(*) >= 10 AND COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) >= 5
      `);
      return this.validatePatterns(patterns);
    }
  }
  ```
  
- [ ] 1.5.7 **Remove Automatic Schema Execution**
  - [ ] Remove `executeMigration()` method entirely
  - [ ] Replace with `createApprovalRequest()` only
  - [ ] All schema changes require human approval
  - [ ] Implement admin notification system
  
- [ ] 1.5.8 **Add Audit Trail System**
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE schema_evolution_audit (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    action TEXT NOT NULL,
    admin_id UUID NOT NULL,
    pattern_data JSONB NOT NULL,
    decision TEXT NOT NULL,
    reasoning TEXT NOT NULL,
    timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
  );
  ```
  
- [ ] 1.5.9 **Input Sanitization & Validation**
  ```typescript
  private sanitizeFieldName(fieldName: string): string {
    // Only allow alphanumeric + underscore
    return fieldName.replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9_]/g, '').toLowerCase();
  }
  
  private validatePattern(pattern: any): boolean {
    return pattern.frequency >= 10 &&
           pattern.user_count >= 5 &&
           pattern.confidence <= 0.95 &&
           this.isValidFieldName(pattern.field_name);
  }
  ```
  
- [ ] 1.5.10 **Update Phase 10 Integration with Security**
  - [ ] Modify `lib/ai/schema-evolution/SchemaAnalyzer.ts` with secure implementation
  - [ ] Update `lib/ai/phase10/Phase10Integration.ts` to use secure analyzer
  - [ ] Add security checks to `app/api/phase10/test-all/route.ts`

## 🗄️ DATABASE SCHEMA VALIDATION (MANDATORY AFTER EACH COMPLETION)

### AUTO-VALIDATION WORKFLOW
After EVERY phase/mini-step completion marked with [x], Claude Code MUST:

1. **Read current schema**: `supabase/migrations/current_schema_2025218_443am`
2. **Scan API routes**: Check all `/app/api/**/*.ts` files for database operations
3. **Identify schema gaps**: Missing tables, fields, constraints, or indexes
4. **Generate migration**: Create new `.sql` file if gaps found
5. **Update status**: Record schema validation results below

### CURRENT SCHEMA STATUS
- **✅ Base Schema**: `current_schema_2025218_443am` (Phases 1-2 complete)
- **⚠️ PENDING MIGRATION**: `20250821_complete_mvp_schema.sql` (Phases 5.1-5.4 requirements)
- **✅ NEW MIGRATION**: `20250823_phase9_personalization.sql` (Phase 9 complete)
- **❗ GAPS IDENTIFIED**: 
  - Missing `workout_sets` table (referenced in workouts API)
  - Missing `coaching_conversations` table (AI coach phases 5.1-5.4)
  - Missing `insights` table (pattern detection phase 5.3)
  - Missing `habit_tracking` table (behavioral design phases 5.1-5.4)
  - Missing `user_achievements` table (gamification system)
  - Missing fields in `workouts`: `logged_at`, `total_sets`, `total_reps`, `total_weight_kg`
  - Missing `common_logs` field in `profiles` table
- **🔄 ACTION REQUIRED**: User must run both migrations on Supabase:
  1. `20250821_complete_mvp_schema.sql` (Core MVP features)
  2. `20250823_phase9_personalization.sql` (Personalization engine)
- **📋 NEXT**: After migrations, consolidate into new `current_schema` file

### VALIDATION ENFORCEMENT
```javascript
// This runs automatically after each [x] completion:
function validateSchemaPostCompletion(phaseName) {
  const currentSchema = readCurrentSchema();
  const apiReferences = scanApiRoutes();
  const gaps = findMissingElements(currentSchema, apiReferences);
  
  if (gaps.length > 0) {
    generateMigration(gaps, `${timestamp}_${phaseName}_schema.sql`);
    updateStatus(`⚠️ SCHEMA UPDATE NEEDED: ${gaps.length} missing elements`);
  } else {
    updateStatus(`✅ Schema validated for ${phaseName}`);
  }
}
```

## 🚨 SECURITY ASSESSMENT & IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### Critical Security Vulnerabilities Found in Phase 10

**Risk Level: CRITICAL (P0)**  
**Impact: Complete database compromise possible**  
**Status: BLOCKS PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT**

#### Vulnerability Analysis

**1. SQL Injection in Schema Evolution**
```typescript
// VULNERABLE CODE:
migration += `ALTER TABLE ${table} ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS ${sug.field} ${sug.dataType}`;
// If sug.field = "malicious'; DROP TABLE users; --"
// Result: Entire user database deleted
```

**2. Excessive Database Privileges**
- Application has DDL permissions (ALTER TABLE, DROP TABLE)
- Can modify any table structure
- Single compromised API key = entire database at risk

**3. No Input Validation**
- User subjective notes directly influence schema changes
- No sanitization of field names
- Malicious users can craft inputs to exploit system

**4. Uncontrolled Data Access**
- Pattern analysis reads ALL user activity logs
- No data minimization or anonymization
- Privacy violations and potential data leaks

**5. Automatic Execution Bypass**
- AI can auto-approve and execute migrations
- Bypasses human oversight for high-confidence changes
- No audit trail for automated decisions

### Secure Architecture Solution

**PostgreSQL + JSONB + Row-Level Security (Recommended)**

#### 1. Database Security Model
```sql
-- Replace schema changes with secure JSONB fields
ALTER TABLE activity_logs ADD COLUMN ai_discovered_fields JSONB DEFAULT '{}';
ALTER TABLE activity_logs ADD COLUMN user_custom_fields JSONB DEFAULT '{}';

-- Enable Row-Level Security
ALTER TABLE activity_logs ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY "Users see own data" ON activity_logs 
  FOR ALL USING (user_id = auth.uid());

-- Separate database roles
CREATE ROLE analytics_readonly WITH LOGIN;  -- No DDL permissions
CREATE ROLE app_user WITH LOGIN;           -- No ALTER TABLE permissions
```

#### 2. Secure Pattern Analysis
```typescript
// SECURE: Aggregate queries only, no individual data access
const patterns = await db.query(`
  SELECT 
    jsonb_object_keys(ai_discovered_fields) as field_name,
    COUNT(*) as frequency,
    COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as user_count  -- No actual user_ids exposed
  FROM activity_logs 
  WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
  GROUP BY jsonb_object_keys(ai_discovered_fields)
  HAVING COUNT(*) >= 10 AND COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) >= 5
`);
```

#### 3. Human-Approved Evolution
```typescript
// SECURE: No automatic execution, only approval requests
async suggestField(pattern: SecurePattern) {
  await db.query(`
    INSERT INTO schema_evolution_requests (pattern_analysis, status) 
    VALUES ($1, 'pending_admin_review')
  `, [JSON.stringify(pattern)]);
  
  // Notify admins, never auto-execute
  await notifyAdmins(pattern);
}
```

### Immediate Actions Required
