## üóÑÔ∏è DATABASE SCHEMA VALIDATION (MANDATORY AFTER EACH COMPLETION)

### AUTO-VALIDATION WORKFLOW
After EVERY phase/mini-step completion marked with [x], Claude Code MUST:

1. **Read current schema**: `supabase/migrations/current_schema_2025218_443am`
2. **Scan API routes**: Check all `/app/api/**/*.ts` files for database operations
3. **Identify schema gaps**: Missing tables, fields, constraints, or indexes
4. **Generate migration**: Create new `.sql` file if gaps found
5. **Update status**: Record schema validation results below

### CURRENT SCHEMA STATUS
- **‚úÖ Base Schema**: `current_schema_2025218_443am` (Phases 1-2 complete)
- **‚ö†Ô∏è PENDING MIGRATION**: `20250821_complete_mvp_schema.sql` (Phases 5.1-5.4 requirements)
- **‚ùó GAPS IDENTIFIED**: 
  - Missing `workout_sets` table (referenced in workouts API)
  - Missing `coaching_conversations` table (AI coach phases 5.1-5.4)
  - Missing `insights` table (pattern detection phase 5.3)
  - Missing `habit_tracking` table (behavioral design phases 5.1-5.4)
  - Missing `user_achievements` table (gamification system)
  - Missing fields in `workouts`: `logged_at`, `total_sets`, `total_reps`, `total_weight_kg`
  - Missing `common_logs` field in `profiles` table
- **üîÑ ACTION REQUIRED**: User must run `20250821_complete_mvp_schema.sql` on Supabase
- **üìã NEXT**: After migration, consolidate into new `current_schema` file

### VALIDATION ENFORCEMENT
```javascript
// This runs automatically after each [x] completion:
function validateSchemaPostCompletion(phaseName) {
  const currentSchema = readCurrentSchema();
  const apiReferences = scanApiRoutes();
  const gaps = findMissingElements(currentSchema, apiReferences);
  
  if (gaps.length > 0) {
    generateMigration(gaps, `${timestamp}_${phaseName}_schema.sql`);
    updateStatus(`‚ö†Ô∏è SCHEMA UPDATE NEEDED: ${gaps.length} missing elements`);
  } else {
    updateStatus(`‚úÖ Schema validated for ${phaseName}`);
  }
}
```

## üö¶ Current Priority - CRITICAL PATH TO LAUNCH

### ‚úÖ PHASE 7 COMPLETE - 5-PAGE APP STRUCTURE
All 5 pages of the MVP app structure have been successfully implemented:
1. **AI Coach Insights** (`/coach-insights`) - Top 2-3 daily insights with expandable details
2. **Quick Log** (`/log`) - Natural language chat interface with voice input
3. **User Dashboard** (`/my-dashboard`) - AI-customized metrics with sidebar
4. **Coach AI** (`/coach`) - Full conversational coaching interface
5. **Settings** (`/settings`) - Complete user preferences and integrations

### üî¥ IMMEDIATE BLOCKERS (Fix First)
1. **Database Migration**: Run `20250821_complete_mvp_schema.sql` on Supabase
2. **TypeScript Errors**: Multiple pre-existing compilation issues in various components
3. **Auth Redirect**: Verify sign-in redirect is working correctly

### üü° WEEK 1 - Core Intelligence (Must Have)
1. **Rule Cards System**: Implement 20 core scenarios
2. **Confidence Scoring**: Add to parser output
3. **Clarifying Questions**: Build "one question max" logic
4. **Common Logs**: Quick re-logging interface

### üü¢ WEEK 2 - User Experience (High Value)
1. **5-Page Structure**: Complete all pages
2. **Dynamic Dashboards**: Personalize by user type
3. **Voice Input**: Implement Web Speech API
4. **Device Integration**: Start with Apple Health

### üîµ WEEK 3 - Polish & Launch
1. **Feedback Loop**: Track advice effectiveness
2. **Pattern Detection**: Enhance existing system
3. **Testing**: 100+ real inputs
4. **Beta Launch**: 10 users

**See [RESEARCH_PRIORITIES.md](./RESEARCH_PRIORITIES.md) for detailed research plan**

## üí° Revolutionary Differentiators with Behavioral Design

This MVP is revolutionary because:
1. **NO FORMS** - Just natural conversation (reducing cognitive load)
2. **VOICE FIRST** - Speak, don't type (minimal friction)
3. **HABIT-CENTRIC** - Built on BJ Fogg's behavior model and James Clear's identity habits
4. **VARIABLE REWARDS** - Unpredictable rewards create engagement (like Duolingo)
5. **SOCIAL ACCOUNTABILITY** - Community features drive 2x retention (like Strava)
6. **IDENTITY TRANSFORMATION** - "Become the person" not just "do the task"
7. **SMART RECOVERY** - Forgiveness features prevent all-or-nothing dropout
8. **TINY HABITS** - Start ridiculously small for guaranteed success
9. **JITAI** - Just-In-Time interventions when users need them most
10. **SELF-DETERMINATION** - Supports autonomy, competence, and relatedness

## üìù Implementation Notes

### Critical Success Factors (Research-Backed)
- **NLP Accuracy**: >80% parsing accuracy (MIT benchmark: 83.8%)
- **Voice Success**: >70% recognition in gym environments
- **Response Time**: <2 seconds for all interactions
- **Habit Formation**: 30-day median formation time
- **Safety First**: 100% medical disclaimers, prompt injection prevention
- **Privacy Compliance**: GDPR/CCPA ready from day 1
- **Motivational Design**: OARS coaching method implementation

### Risk Mitigation (Research-Informed)
- **NLP Accuracy Issues**: Fallback to manual entry, few-shot learning
- **API Cost Overrun**: Cache aggressively, use free tier Gemini (80%)
- **Voice Recognition Failure**: Simple commands only, text fallback
- **Compliance Complexity**: Conservative approach, US-first launch
- **Habit Disruption**: Streak freeze (1/week), forgiveness features
- **Cognitive Overload**: Tiny habits (BJ Fogg method)
- **Safety Concerns**: Medical disclaimers, injury detection
