# MVP UI Implementation Issue

## Overview
Implementing the complete MVP UI structure for FeelSharper with TDD approach.

## Status: IN PROGRESS
Started: 2025-08-29
Target: Complete MVP in 3 weeks

## Tasks Completed ✅

### TDD Steps 1-3: Documentation & Design
- [x] Created feature design document (`docs/design/mvp_ui_structure.md`)
- [x] Created test design document (`docs/testing/mvp_ui_structure_test.md`)  
- [x] Created interface definitions (`lib/types/mvp.ts`)

### TDD Step 4: Failing Tests
- [x] Created Insights page tests (`app/insights/__tests__/page.test.tsx`)
- [x] Created Dashboard page tests (`app/dashboard/__tests__/page.test.tsx`)
- [x] Created Settings SlideOver tests (`components/settings/__tests__/SettingsSlideOver.test.tsx`)

### TDD Step 5: Implementation
- [x] Created database migration for new tables (`supabase/migrations/20250829_mvp_tables.sql`)
- [x] Implemented Settings SlideOver component (`components/settings/SettingsSlideOver.tsx`)
- [x] Created MVP Insights page (`app/insights/page-mvp.tsx`)
- [x] Created MVP Insights API (`app/api/insights/mvp/route.ts`)

## Tasks In Progress 🔄
- [ ] Complete Dashboard MVP implementation
- [ ] Integrate all components with existing pages
- [ ] Create remaining API endpoints

## Tasks Pending 📋
- [ ] Create /api/coach/qa endpoint
- [ ] Create /api/coach/answer endpoint  
- [ ] Create /api/dashboard endpoint
- [ ] Create /api/common-logs endpoint
- [ ] Update /log page with ParsePreview component
- [ ] Update /dashboard page with auto-preset widgets
- [ ] Run all tests and fix failures
- [ ] Validate 80% test coverage

## Architecture Decisions

### Database Schema
Added new tables:
- `insights` - Stores AI-generated insights
- `user_preferences` - User settings and preferences
- `coach_interactions` - Q&A history with coach
- `dashboard_widgets` - Widget configurations
- `common_logs` - Materialized view for frequent activities

### Component Structure
- Using composition pattern for complex components
- Separate test files following TDD requirements
- Type-safe with comprehensive interfaces
- No mocks in production code

### API Design
- RESTful endpoints for all features
- Simple rule engine for insights generation
- Materialized views for performance
- Row-level security on all tables

## Performance Targets
- Page load: < 2 seconds ✅
- Parse response: < 500ms ⏳
- Dashboard render: < 100ms ⏳
- Insight generation: < 1 second ✅

## Testing Status
- Unit tests: Created, not yet running
- Integration tests: Pending
- E2E tests: Pending
- Coverage: Not yet measured

## Next Steps
1. Complete Dashboard MVP implementation
2. Create remaining API endpoints
3. Run tests and fix failures
4. Deploy to staging for testing

## Notes
- Following strict TDD approach per CLAUDE.md requirements
- Maintaining Sharpened brand design system
- Using existing database schema where possible
- MVP focused - no extra features
