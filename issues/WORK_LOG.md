### Session: Reality Check and Documentation Update
- **Time**: 10:00 AM - 11:30 AM (1.5 hours)
- **Work Done**:
  - Analyzed actual implementation vs claimed features
  - Discovered build failures (4 TypeScript errors)
  - Found test failures (3 of 4 suites)
  - Updated MVP_LAUNCH_PLAN.md with reality
  - Set up issue tracking system
  - Added TDD requirements to workflow
- **Findings**:
  - Project claims 75% complete but is actually ~30%
  - Most "complete" features are just files that exist
  - No deployment, no production testing
  - Build completely blocked by TypeScript errors
- **Next Actions**:
  - Fix TypeScript errors in csv-parser
  - Follow TDD process for all fixes
  - Update issue tracking throughout
