# Work History & Decisions

## 2025-08-29

### Major Decisions

#### Decision: Don't Switch to Python Backend
- **Context**: Considered rewriting backend in Python/FastAPI
- **Analysis**: 
  - 17,842 TypeScript files already exist
  - Only 4 errors blocking entire build
  - Switching would take 2-4 weeks minimum
- **Decision**: Fix TypeScript errors instead of rewrite
- **Rationale**: Don't throw away months of work for 4 errors

#### Decision: Implement TDD & Issue Tracking
- **Context**: Project lacks proper testing and tracking
- **Requirements Added**:
  - 6-step TDD sequence for all features
  - Mandatory issue tracking in /issues/
  - Minimum 80% test coverage
  - No mocks in production code
- **Impact**: Slower initial progress but higher quality

### Blockers Encountered

#### Blocker: TypeScript Compilation Errors
- **Files**: csv-parser.test.ts (lines 96-98), csv-parser.ts (line 211)
- **Impact**: Complete build failure
- **Priority**: P0 - Must fix first

#### Blocker: Test Suite Failures
- **Status**: 3 of 4 test suites failing
- **Impact**: Cannot validate any functionality
- **Priority**: P1 - Fix after build

### Key Learnings
1. Documentation claimed 75% complete but reality is ~30%
2. Most "complete" features are untested file stubs
3. No production deployment or real user testing
4. Need strict TDD to avoid this situation again
