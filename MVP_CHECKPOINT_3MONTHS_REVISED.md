## Month 1: Intelligence & Accuracy (Sept 20 - Oct 20)

### Week 4-5: Enhanced Parsing to 85%+
**Issue #101: Improve Parser Accuracy**

#### Leverage Existing Code:
```typescript
// You already have:
- EnhancedFoodParser with USDA matching
- WorkoutParser with pattern learning
- Confidence scoring system

// Just need to:
1. Add more training patterns
2. Implement context from previous logs
3. Add portion size estimation logic
```

#### Key Tasks:
- [ ] Analyze beta user failures - **2 days**
- [ ] Add 50+ common food patterns - **2 days**
- [ ] Implement "same as yesterday" logic - **1 day**
- [ ] Add meal context (breakfast/lunch/dinner) - **1 day**
- [ ] Test with 100+ real inputs - **2 days**

### Week 6-7: Apple Health Integration (GAME CHANGER)
**Issue #102: Connect Apple Health**

#### You Already Have:
```typescript
// lib/integrations/HealthKitSync.ts exists!
- Basic structure defined
- Data interfaces ready
```

#### Implementation:
1. **iOS Setup** - **2 days**
   - Request HealthKit permissions
   - Set up data types (workouts, sleep, HR, weight)
   
2. **Sync Logic** - **3 days**
   - Pull workouts automatically
   - Import sleep data
   - Get heart rate data
   - Handle conflicts with manual logs

3. **Confidence Boost** - **1 day**
   - Mark device data as 95%+ confidence
   - Override manual logs when device data exists

### Week 8: Common Logs Perfection
**Issue #103: Make Logging Effortless**

Your Vision: *"Make it so that frequent logs are extremely easy to be redone"*

```typescript
// Implementation:
1. Track top 20 common logs per user
2. Smart predictions based on:
   - Time of day
   - Day of week
   - Recent patterns
3. One-tap confirmation
4. Voice shortcut: "usual breakfast"
```

### Week 11: User Type Perfection
**Issue #105: Dynamic Dashboards by User Type**

Your Vision: *"A triathlon person, a tennis player and a bodybuilder should have completely different dashboards"*

#### Already Built:
- 5 dashboard presets exist
- PresetSelector component ready
- Widget system in place

#### Enhancement:
```typescript
// Auto-detect user type from logs:
if (logs.include("swim", "bike", "run")) â†’ TRIATHLETE
if (logs.include("sets", "reps", "bench")) â†’ BODYBUILDER  
if (logs.include("tennis", "serve", "match")) â†’ TENNIS_PLAYER

// Customize dashboard:
TRIATHLETE: pace, HR zones, weekly volume, recovery
BODYBUILDER: volume, PRs, protein, recovery
TENNIS_PLAYER: hours, win rate, subjective performance
```

### Week 12: Subjective Feelings Tracking
**Issue #106: Capture How Users Feel**

Your Vision: *"They play tennis and mention they played poorly... They might say they were really happy"*

```typescript
// Parse subjective states:
"played poorly" â†’ performance: low, mood: frustrated
"felt great" â†’ performance: high, mood: positive
"sluggish in 2nd set" â†’ fatigue: high, timing: late

// Store in database:
{
  objective: { duration: 90, sport: "tennis" },
  subjective: { performance: "poor", mood: "frustrated", notes: "sluggish in 2nd set" }
}

// Use in insights:
"Your performance tends to drop when sleep < 7 hours"
```

### Week 13: Photo Food Recognition
**Issue #107: Calorie Estimation from Photos**

#### You Already Have:
```typescript
// UnifiedNaturalInput.tsx has photo upload!

   ```typescript
   // Send photo to GPT-4 Vision
   // Get: foods detected, portions, cooking method
   // Return with confidence bands
   ```

2. **Confidence-Based Calories** - **2 days**
   ```typescript
   High confidence: "320 calories (Â±10%)"
   Medium: "300-400 calories"  
   Low: "Approximately 350 calories"
   ```

## Month 3: Polish & Scale (Nov 21 - Nov 29)

### Week 14: Knowledge Base Automation
**Issue #108: Always Updated Science**

Your Vision: *"Should I have an automation that always updates the AI knowledge base"*

```typescript
// Implementation:
1. Weekly research scan (PubMed, Sports Science)
2. AI summarizes new findings
3. Admin reviews (safety check)
4. Auto-updates rule cards
5. Cites sources in advice

// Example:
"Recent research (Nov 2025, Journal of Sports Medicine) suggests..."
```

### Week 15: Advanced Clarifying Questions
**Issue #109: One Perfect Question**

Your Vision: *"Ask questions where needed... don't be asking too much information"*

```typescript
// Smart question selection:
if (criticalDataMissing && wouldChangeAdvice) {
  // Ask ONLY the most important question
  questions.sortBy(importance)
  askOne(questions[0])
} else {
  // Give best advice with available data
  provideGeneralGuidance()
}
```

2. **Voice** - Working, needs mobile testing
3. **Rule Cards** - 20+ defined with clarifying questions
4. **Dashboards** - 5 types built, needs data connection
5. **Components** - UI ready, just needs wiring

### Focus Order (Based on Your Vision):
1. **Weeks 1-3**: Connect existing code (done)
2. **Weeks 4-8**: Parsing accuracy + Apple Health
3. **Weeks 9-12**: Garmin + User types + Photos
4. **Weeks 13-16**: Polish + Knowledge base + Launch

### Game Changers (Your Words):
- **Apple Health** (Week 6-7) - *"That will be a game changer"*

## ðŸ’¡ Final Reality Check

### What Makes This Realistic:
1. **70% of code exists** - You're not starting from scratch
2. **3-week MVP first** - Proves core concept before adding features
3. **Device integrations early** - Your identified game-changers by Month 2
4. **Gradual accuracy improvement** - 75% â†’ 85% â†’ 90% over time
5. **Beta users throughout** - Real feedback drives priorities

### Biggest Risks:
1. **Device API complexity** - Apple/Garmin APIs can be tricky
2. **Photo accuracy** - GPT-4 Vision costs and accuracy
3. **Mobile voice issues** - Browser compatibility varies
4. **User retention** - Need quick value demonstration

### Mitigation:
- Start device integrations early (Month 1)
- Have fallbacks for everything
- Test on real devices weekly
- Show value in first 30 seconds of use
