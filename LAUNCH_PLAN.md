# üöÄ FeelSharper Production Launch Plan
*Last Updated: 2025-08-29*

## üéØ Core Vision

**The Problem**: Other apps = endless forms & menus  
**Our Solution**: FeelSharper = just talk, AI does the rest

üí¨ **Example**:
```
You: "Eggs & toast, ran 5k, weight 175, feeling great"
AI: "Logged! Great pace improvement. You're on track‚Äîtomorrow try adding 10min mobility work."
```

## üß† Revolutionary Approach

### What Makes Us Different
1. **Natural Language First**: No forms, just conversation (text or voice)
2. **Adaptive Intelligence**: AI understands context and asks ONE clarifying question when needed
3. **Confidence-Aware**: Precise advice when data is clear, directional guidance when uncertain
4. **User-Type Personalization**: Triathlete vs tennis player vs bodybuilder see completely different dashboards
5. **Subjective + Objective**: Tracks both "ran 5k" AND "felt sluggish"

### The 5-Page App Structure
1. **AI Coach Page**: Top 2-3 insights in simple terms, expandable for details
2. **Quick Log Page**: Chat box + voice input + common logs shortcuts
3. **My Dashboard**: AI-curated widgets based on user type and goals
4. **Coach Chat**: Deep Q&A with the AI coach
5. **Settings**: Profile, preferences, goals, dietary restrictions

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Core Data Flow
```
User Input (text/voice/device) 
    ‚Üì
Parse to Structured JSON + Confidence Score
    ‚Üì
Apply Rule Cards (20-30 scenarios)
    ‚Üì
Generate Insights (confidence-aware)
    ‚Üì
Update Dashboard (user-type specific)
    ‚Üì
Track Feedback ‚Üí Improve
```

### Key Components

#### 1. Natural Language Parser (Python)
- **Input**: "eggs and toast, ran 5k, feeling great"
- **Output**: JSON with type, values, confidence (0-100%)
- **Handles**: Food, workouts, weight, mood, sleep, subjective feelings
- **Special**: Stores both raw text AND structured data

#### 2. Rule Engine (Python) 
- **20-30 Rule Cards** covering common scenarios:
  - Pre-workout fueling (2-4h before)
  - Post-workout recovery
  - Sleep deficit handling
  - Soreness/DOMS
  - Weight plateau
  - Low energy
  - Mood variations
- **Each card has**: Trigger ‚Üí Response ‚Üí Optional clarifying question
- **Adapts to**: User goals, dietary restrictions, sport type

#### 3. Confidence Scoring System
- **High confidence (80-100%)**: Device data, clear logs ‚Üí Precise numbers
- **Medium confidence (50-80%)**: Estimated portions ‚Üí Ranges
- **Low confidence (<50%)**: Vague logs ‚Üí Directional guidance

#### 4. User-Type Dashboards (TypeScript/React)
- **Endurance Athlete**: Training load, HR zones, weekly mileage
- **Tennis Player**: Hours trained, subjective performance, consistency
- **Bodybuilder**: Protein intake, strength progression, recovery
- **Weight Management**: Calorie balance, weight trend, habits
- **Wellness User**: Steps, sleep, mood, stress

## üé® Critical Implementation Details

### The 20 Core Rule Cards (MVP Brain)
```python
1. Pre-Workout (2-4h): "Eat carbs + protein"
2. Pre-Workout (<1h): "Light snack only"  
3. Post-Workout: "Protein within 2h"
4. Sleep Deficit: "Lower expectations today"
5. Hydration: "400-800ml after sweating"
6. Soreness: "Light movement helps"
7. Weight Plateau: "Check calories/protein"
8. Low Energy: "Quick carbs or rest"
9. High Training Load: "Prioritize recovery"
10. Protein Check: "You need more protein"
11. Injury Flag: "Rest and see professional"
12. Competition Soon: "Taper and fuel"
13. Mood Low: "This is normal, be kind"
14. Travel: "Hydrate and move"
15. Illness: "Full rest required"
16. Overtraining: "Mandatory rest day"
17. Great Session: "Remember this prep"
18. Vegan Needs: "Plant protein + B12"
19. Weather Hot: "Extra electrolytes"
20. No Recent Logs: "How are you doing?"
```

### Clarifying Question Logic
```javascript
// Only ask if it changes the advice significantly
if (missingCriticalData && wouldChangeRecommendation) {
  askONEQuestion();
} else {
  giveGeneralAdvice();
}
```

### Confidence Scoring in Practice
```
Device data (Garmin): 95-100% confidence
Clear text ("200g chicken"): 80-95% confidence  
Estimated ("plate of pasta"): 50-80% confidence
Vague ("had lunch"): 20-50% confidence

High confidence ‚Üí "You need 47g more protein"
Low confidence ‚Üí "Try to get more protein today"
```

## ‚ö° Week 1 Sprint (What to Build RIGHT NOW)

### Day 1: Fix the Build ‚úÖ
```bash
# Morning (2 hours)
- Fix 4 TypeScript errors in csv-parser
- Remove broken test files
- Get npm run build working

# Afternoon (2 hours)  
- Deploy to Vercel
- Verify it loads without errors
```

### Day 2-3: Basic Parser üß†
```python
# Build parse_log() function that handles:
"eggs and toast" ‚Üí {type: "food", items: ["eggs", "toast"], confidence: 70}
"ran 5k" ‚Üí {type: "workout", activity: "run", distance: 5, unit: "km", confidence: 90}
"weight 175" ‚Üí {type: "weight", value: 175, unit: "lbs", confidence: 100}
"feeling tired" ‚Üí {type: "mood", value: "tired", confidence: 100}
```

### Day 4-5: First 5 Rule Cards üìã
```python
rules = {
  "pre_workout": "If workout in 2-4h ‚Üí eat carbs + protein",
  "post_workout": "If just exercised ‚Üí protein within 2h",
  "low_sleep": "If <6h sleep ‚Üí reduce intensity today",
  "hydration": "If sweated ‚Üí drink 400-800ml",
  "protein": "If <0.8g/kg ‚Üí add protein source"
}
```

### Day 6-7: Minimal UI üé®
```typescript
// Just 3 pages that work:
1. /log ‚Üí Text input box that saves to database
2. /insights ‚Üí Shows 2-3 AI recommendations
3. /dashboard ‚Üí Weight graph + last 5 logs
```

**End of Week 1**: Users can type, AI parses, insights appear

## üéØ Reality Check: Success Milestones

### Month 2: Proof of Concept ‚úÖ
- [ ] 10 daily active beta users
- [ ] 80% parsing accuracy on common logs
- [ ] 5 working rule cards
- [ ] Basic dashboard shows data

- [ ] 100 daily active users
- [ ] 90% parsing accuracy
- [ ] Voice input working
- [ ] 15+ rule cards covering main scenarios

### Month 6: Integration Complete üîå
- [ ] Garmin + Apple Watch syncing
- [ ] Photo food logging operational
- [ ] Dynamic dashboards by user type
- [ ] 500+ daily active users
- **Reality**: This is when it becomes sticky

- [ ] Confidence scoring drives all advice
- [ ] 20+ rule cards with clarifying questions
- [ ] 1,000+ daily active users
- **Reality**: AI should feel like a real coach

### Month 10: Beta Success üìà
- [ ] 100+ beta users retained >30 days
- [ ] <2s load times
- [ ] Major bugs squashed
- [ ] NPS score >50
- **Reality**: Ready for public only if retention is strong

### Month 12: Market Entry üöÄ
- [ ] 10,000+ registered users
- [ ] 1,000+ paying subscribers
- [ ] $10K+ MRR
- [ ] <$50 CAC
- **Reality**: Series A possible if metrics hold

## üö® Critical Success Factors

### What MUST Work
1. **Natural language parsing** - If users have to think about how to log, we've failed
2. **Confidence scoring** - Advice must adapt to data quality
3. **One clarifying question max** - More friction = death
4. **Device integrations** - Garmin/Apple Watch are deal-breakers for athletes
5. **<5 second time to log** - Speed is everything

### What Will Kill Us
1. **Bad parsing** - If AI misunderstands frequently, users leave
2. **Generic advice** - Must feel personalized or it's worthless
3. **Too many questions** - Friction kills engagement
4. **Slow performance** - 3+ seconds = abandoned
5. **Privacy concerns** - One breach = game over

## üí° The Big Bet

**We're betting that people want to track their fitness by talking, not filling out forms.**

If we're right, FeelSharper becomes the default way people log their health data. Natural language becomes the interface. The AI coach becomes their trusted advisor.

If we're wrong, we've still built incredible parsing technology that can pivot to other verticals (medical, mental health, productivity).

## üìù Final Reality Check

This plan is **ambitious but achievable** with focused execution:

- **Month 1-2**: Build core parser + basic UI (high risk, must work)
- **Month 3-4**: Add intelligence + voice (medium risk, differentiator)  
- **Month 5-6**: Integrations + dashboards (low risk, expected)
- **Month 7-8**: Advanced AI + photos (medium risk, nice to have)
- **Month 9-10**: Beta + refinement (low risk, necessary)
- **Month 11-12**: Scale + launch (high risk, execution critical)

**The key insight**: If natural language logging works well, everything else is execution. That's why the first 2 months are everything.
