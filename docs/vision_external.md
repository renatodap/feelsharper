Problem

Today’s fitness apps fall into two traps:

Too generic: One-size-fits-all dashboards (Strava, MyFitnessPal) that don’t adapt to the athlete’s unique profile.

Too fragmented: Users juggle 3–5 apps for workouts, food, recovery, and notes, with no unified view.

Too shallow: Current “AI” features are marketing fluff — not personalized, not science-backed, not grounded in the user’s actual history.

Result: Athletes and fitness enthusiasts get vague, inconsistent advice instead of the precise, context-aware coaching they need.

Target User

Fitness enthusiasts and athletes who:

Want a single source of truth for training, nutrition, recovery, and subjective feelings.

Value precision and personalization over generic calorie counts or training graphs.

Expect tools to be effortless: fast logging, wearable integrations, and advice that adapts to them.

Unique Bet

FeelSharper is the first platform to combine:

Organized user data: meticulous profiles storing workouts, meals, sleep, and subjective notes.

AI precision: logs parsed into structured data with confidence levels.

Expert-backed knowledge: recommendations grounded in science and professional guidelines.

Dynamic dashboards: AI classifies new users (triathlete, tennis player, bodybuilder, or casual fitness enthusiast) and tailors KPIs to their goals.

Ease of use: frequent logs in <10 seconds, wearable sync, 1-tap common logs.

How We’re Different

Strava → Great for community and training load. Weak on nutrition and personalization.

MyFitnessPal → Strong calorie database. Weak on performance metrics, poor AI.

Whoop → Solid recovery metrics. Weak dashboards and limited nutrition context.

FeelSharper → Unifies all three, adds AI personalization, and delivers science-backed precision + ease of use.
