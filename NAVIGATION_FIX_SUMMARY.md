# Navigation Fix Summary
*Date: 2025-08-29*

## Issues Identified
1. **Wrong dashboard displayed** - Old dashboard was showing instead of MVP version
2. **Non-existent /today route** - App was redirecting to `/today` which doesn't exist (404 error)
3. **Logged-in users seeing landing page** - Instead of being redirected to their dashboard

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Redirect Destinations
Changed all references from `/today` to `/insights` in:
- `components/auth/AuthProvider.tsx` - Main auth state handler
- `components/auth/AuthGuard.tsx` - Auth guard component
- `app/auth/callback/route.ts` - OAuth callback handler
- `app/(auth)/sign-in/page.tsx` - Sign-in page
- `app/(auth)/sign-up/page.tsx` - Sign-up page
- `components/auth/GoogleAuthButton.tsx` - Google OAuth button

### 2. Updated AuthenticatedLayout
Added logic to redirect logged-in users from landing page (`/`) to insights page (`/insights`)

### 3. Navigation Structure
The app now properly routes users:
- **Not logged in**: Landing page (`/`) → Sign in → Insights (`/insights`)
- **Logged in**: Automatically redirected from `/` to `/insights`
- **MVP Pages Available**:
  - `/insights` - AI Coach with insights and Q&A
  - `/log` - Natural language activity logging
  - `/dashboard` - Main dashboard with metrics
  - Settings - Accessible via avatar click

## Current User Flow
1. User logs in via `/sign-in`
2. After successful auth, redirected to `/insights` (Coach page)
3. Can navigate between MVP pages using:
   - Desktop: Top navigation bar
   - Mobile: Bottom tab bar
4. Settings accessible via avatar click (slide-over panel)

## Testing
- Development server running successfully
- All routes compile without errors
- Navigation between pages working as expected

## Next Steps
1. Ensure insights page properly displays user's actual data
2. Remove any remaining mock/fake data
3. Test full user journey from signup to using all features
