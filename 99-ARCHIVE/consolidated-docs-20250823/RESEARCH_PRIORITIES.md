*Last Updated: 2025-08-21*

## üéØ MVP Critical Research (Implement Now)

### 1. Natural Language Processing for Health Data ‚ö° PRIORITY
**Why Critical**: Core to the "no forms" MVP promise

#### Immediate Implementation:
- **Ambiguity Resolution**: 
  - "protein shake" ‚Üí prompt for brand/size via confidence scoring
  - "ran 5k" ‚Üí assume kilometers (add context detection)
  - Cache user's common entries for faster future parsing
  
- **Temporal Expression Parsing**:
  - "worked out this morning" ‚Üí timestamp extraction
  - "had lunch 2 hours ago" ‚Üí relative time calculation
  - Use Gemini's free tier for 80% of parsing

- **Voice Error Correction**:
  - Handle common transcription errors ("one egg" vs "1g")
  - Context-based validation (eggs measured in count, not grams)
  - Implement fallback confirmations for low-confidence parses

#### MVP Baseline Target:
- 83.8% accuracy on food items (MIT research benchmark)
- 92.2% accuracy on quantity resolution
- <2 second response time

### 2. AI Coach Personality & Conversation Design ‚ö° PRIORITY
**Why Critical**: Defines the entire user experience

#### Immediate Implementation:
- **Motivational Interviewing (MI) Basics**:
  ```
  Instead of: "You should run more"
  Use: "How did you feel after your last run?"
  ```
  - OARS method: Open questions, Affirmations, Reflective listening, Summaries
  - Empathy-first responses for trust building

- **Adaptive Tone (Simple Version)**:
  - Start with 3 presets: Gentle, Balanced, Push
  - User selects during onboarding
  - AI adjusts based on detected mood keywords

- **Conversation Memory**:
  - Store last 5 exchanges + user profile summary
  - Persist key facts (injuries, preferences, goals)
  - Use context injection for continuity

#### MVP Safety Guardrails:
- Medical disclaimer on every health suggestion
- Injury detection ‚Üí "Please see a doctor"
- No extreme diet/exercise recommendations

### 3. Voice UX for Core Actions ‚ö° PRIORITY
**Why Critical**: Voice-first is a key differentiator

#### Immediate Implementation (Top 10 Commands):
```javascript
1. "Log my [meal]: [description]"
2. "I [exercised] for [duration]"
3. "Start tracking my [activity]"
4. "Stop tracking"
5. "How many calories today?"
6. "What's my weight trend?"
7. "I weigh [number] [units]"
8. "I feel [mood/energy]"
9. "What should I do today?"
10. "Show my progress"
```

#### Technical Approach:
- Use Web Speech API for browser
- Leverage device's native speech recognition
- Implement confirmation for ambiguous commands
- Add noise handling for gym environments

### 4. Privacy & Medical Compliance ‚ö° PRIORITY
**Why Critical**: Legal requirement and trust foundation

#### Day 1 Requirements:
- **Data Security**:
  - HTTPS everywhere
  - Encryption at rest and in transit
  - Secure token storage for API integrations

- **Compliance Basics**:
  - GDPR consent flow for EU users
  - Data export/delete functionality
  - Medical disclaimer on all pages
  - Age gate (16+ or parental consent)

- **Platform Policies**:
  - Apple HealthKit: No ads, no data selling
  - Google Fit: OAuth2 with minimal scopes
  - Clear privacy policy with data usage

### 5. LLM Prompt Engineering ‚ö° PRIORITY
**Why Critical**: Powers both parsing and coaching

#### Immediate Implementation:
```python
# Few-shot learning template for parsing
prompt = """
User: I ran 2 miles in 18 minutes
Parse: {"activity": "running", "distance": 2, "unit": "miles", "duration": 18}

User: Had 2 eggs and toast for breakfast
Parse: {"meal": "breakfast", "foods": ["eggs", "toast"], "quantities": [2, 1]}

User: [NEW INPUT]
Parse:
"""

# Chain-of-thought for complex queries
prompt = """
Think step-by-step:
1. Identify the activity type
2. Extract quantities and units
3. Note any subjective descriptors
4. Structure the data
"""
```

#### Safety Measures:
- Prompt injection prevention
- Confidence scoring (0-100)
- Fallback to clarifying questions
- Never provide medical advice
