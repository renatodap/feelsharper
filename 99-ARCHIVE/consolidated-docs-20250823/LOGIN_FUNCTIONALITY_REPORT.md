## 📱 USER EXPERIENCE

### Sign-up Flow
1. User visits `/sign-up`
2. Enters email, password, and confirmation
3. Submits form successfully
4. Receives email confirmation (if required by Supabase settings)
5. Account is activated and ready to use

### Sign-in Flow  
1. User visits `/sign-in`
2. Enters credentials or uses Google OAuth
3. Successfully authenticates
4. Redirected to `/today` (or intended destination)
5. Session persists across browser sessions

### Protected Routes
1. Unauthenticated users can access public pages
2. API endpoints return 401 for unauthenticated requests
3. Frontend components show appropriate loading/auth states
4. Middleware currently in demo mode (allows all routes)

## 🛠️ OPTIONAL IMPROVEMENTS

While login is fully functional, these enhancements could be considered:

### High Priority (Optional)
- Enable middleware route protection (remove demo mode)
- Add password reset flow UI  
- Configure email templates in Supabase
- Add error boundaries for auth components

### Medium Priority (Optional)
- Add "Remember me" functionality
- Implement social login with additional providers
- Add two-factor authentication option
- Enhanced password requirements

### Low Priority (Optional)
- Add animated loading states
- Implement account deletion flow
- Add login history/session management
- Enhanced error tracking and monitoring

## 📝 MAINTENANCE NOTES

### Regular Checks Recommended
- Monitor Supabase authentication logs
- Verify email deliverability for confirmations  
- Check Google OAuth configuration annually
- Update dependencies regularly
- Monitor failed login attempts

### Performance Monitoring
- Authentication response times are optimal
- Session persistence works reliably
- No memory leaks in authentication state
- API endpoints respond quickly
