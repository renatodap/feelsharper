  OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
  ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_claude_key
  ```

### 2. Database Migration (30 min)
- [ ] Run migrations in Supabase production:
  1. `UPDATE_TO_MVP_SCHEMA.sql`
  2. `UPDATE_WORKOUT_EXERCISE_SCHEMA.sql`
  3. `MVP_SCHEMA_OPTIMIZATION.sql`
- [ ] Verify all tables created
- [ ] Test RLS policies

### 3. Performance Optimization (1-2 hours)
- [ ] Add Redis/caching for AI responses
- [ ] Optimize API response times (<500ms target)
- [ ] Enable CDN for static assets
- [ ] Configure rate limiting

### 4. Deployment Platform Setup (30 min)
Choose one:

#### Option A: Vercel (Recommended)
```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel --prod
```

#### Option B: Railway
```bash
railway login
railway up
```

#### Option C: Self-hosted
```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

### 5. Domain & SSL (30 min)
- [ ] Configure custom domain
- [ ] Set up SSL certificate
- [ ] Update CORS settings
- [ ] Configure DNS records

## 🎯 Launch Day Tasks

### Morning
- [ ] Final backup of development database
- [ ] Deploy to production
- [ ] Run smoke tests on production URL
- [ ] Verify all API endpoints working

### Testing
- [ ] Test natural language input: "weight 175"
- [ ] Test food logging: "had eggs for breakfast"
- [ ] Test exercise logging: "ran 5k"
- [ ] Test multi-activity: "weight 175, ran 5k, had eggs"
- [ ] Test on mobile devices

### Monitoring
- [ ] Set up error tracking (Sentry/LogRocket)
- [ ] Configure uptime monitoring
- [ ] Set up analytics (PostHog/Plausible)
- [ ] Create alerts for API failures

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Technical
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ TypeScript compiles
- ✅ Build succeeds
- ⚠️ Response times <500ms (currently 2.6s)
- ✅ Error rate <1%

### User Experience
- Natural language parsing accuracy >90%
- Page load time <3 seconds
- Mobile responsive
- Offline support (PWA)

## 🚨 Rollback Plan

If critical issues arise:
1. Revert to previous deployment
2. Restore database backup
3. Disable problematic features via feature flags
4. Communicate with users

## 📱 Post-Launch

### Week 1
- Monitor error logs daily
- Gather user feedback
- Fix critical bugs immediately
- Optimize slow queries

### Week 2
- Analyze usage patterns
- Plan feature improvements
- Start A/B testing
- Begin scaling optimizations

## 🎉 Launch Command

When ready, run:
```bash
# Final checks
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build

# Deploy
vercel --prod

# Verify
curl https://your-domain.com/api/health
```
