# üö® URGENT SECURITY FIX REQUIRED üö®

## CRITICAL SECURITY VULNERABILITY DETECTED

**Status**: Tables are currently accessible WITHOUT authentication!
**Risk Level**: CRITICAL - User data is exposed
**Action Required**: IMMEDIATE

## Vulnerable Tables:
- ‚ùå `activity_logs` - ALL user activity data exposed
- ‚ùå `body_measurements` - Personal body data exposed  
- ‚ùå `custom_foods` - User food data exposed

## How to Apply the Fix:

### Option 1: Via Supabase CLI (Recommended)
```bash
# 1. Link your project (you'll need your database password)
npx supabase link --project-ref uayxgxeueyjiokhvmjwd

# 2. Apply the migrations
npx supabase db push
```

### Option 2: Via Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/uayxgxeueyjiokhvmjwd/sql/new
2. Copy and paste the contents of `supabase/migrations/20250829_enable_rls.sql`
3. Click "Run" to execute

### Option 3: Direct SQL Connection
Use any PostgreSQL client with your connection string and run:
```sql
-- Contents of supabase/migrations/20250829_enable_rls.sql
```

## Verification After Fix:
```bash
# Run the security test
node test-rls-security.mjs
```

All tests should show "‚úÖ RLS Working"

## Why This is Critical:
Without RLS enabled, ANY user can:
- Read ALL users' activity logs
- Read ALL users' body measurements
- Read ALL users' custom foods
- Potentially modify or delete other users' data

This MUST be fixed before ANY production launch!

## Migrations to Apply:
1. `supabase/migrations/20250829_mvp_tables.sql` - Creates tables with RLS for new tables
2. `supabase/migrations/20250829_enable_rls.sql` - Enables RLS for existing tables
